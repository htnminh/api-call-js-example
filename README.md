```
leave @_example.js  as is. in @api_call_example.js , do the following:
- follow the example
- let me set up private credentials in an environment variable file (.env file)
- add that file to git ignore
- in directory /images, download 5 images from unsplash
- list the 5 download links in /images/README.md 
we will develop more in next steps, just do that for now.
```
```
your tools don't allow you to edit .env file. write me the format of the file.
```
```
all the 4 ids are not private credentials., only the pat. fix the @api_call_example.js when .env only contains CLARIFAI_PAT=6bbaca97a4be4845879323f4bd455587
```
```
i have put the response in @_example_output.json 
is there a (simple) way to visualize this?
```
```
i just realized there are no bounding boxes. now, simply merge the @visualize_results.js into @api_call_example.js , and don't print the raw json into the output, just the formatted result.
```
```
can i delete @visualize_results.js now? 
```
    since the names of objects could be arbitrarily long, and i want some more information, format the output like this
    ```
    Image recognition with Clarifai
    ==========
    Image URL: <the url>
    Model ID: <id>
    Model version ID: <ver id>
    ==========
    <a simple terminal table with headers: Confidence (%), Concept
    the columns are in that order, and the confidence numbers without percentage mark>
    ```
```
i have deleted the /images directory and made some modifications in @api_call_example.js . create a file named image_urls.txt, in which it contains an url of image on each line. make the @api_call_example.js calls fetch from that file instead.
```
```
since i have read that they limit 1 call / sec. make the wait 1 second between each call.
```
```
some images have this issue. i think it's due to async. don't use async at all, simply loop through them. we'll see if the error persist.

the errors are still the same. likely due to this function.

seems like there's some "\r" in the string. comment out (don't remove, that might be helpful in the future) the logging you've done. make sure no "\n" or "\r" or some weird escape characters slide in the urls.
